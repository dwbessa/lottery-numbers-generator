# Lotto-num
I wanted to bet in lottery and didn't know which numbers use... so I did this program

This is the english version of the program, if you want to try in portuguese, go to root.

## The Program

Lotto-num is a random number generator program that helps you to choose the numbers wanted for you to make your lottery bet (and help you get rich OR problably having fun trying to)

## Running the program

You just have to run:

```git clone <repository-url>```

and run: 

```"make bet"```

## Why this?

I just got bored.
